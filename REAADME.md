### Planning

##### Make models
 - ‚úÖ Events
 - ‚úÖ Participants
 - ‚úÖ Nets
 - ‚úÖ Rounds
 - Add unique serial no for paryicapant - track last record sl, If that is 15 start from 1
 - ‚úÖ Upload players
 - ‚úÖ Csv to json
 - ‚úÖ Json file key and value validation
 - ‚úÖ And save json object to mongodb
 - ‚úÖ Create event front end
 - ‚úÖ Modify add participant and show participant - Add more fields for adding a participant
 - ‚úÖ Delete event and delete all participant of that event - Delete event frontend
 - ‚úÖ Delete participant 
 - ‚úÖ Add participant with files
 - ‚úÖ when participant is been deleted delete that from events participants
 - ‚úÖ Assign players to net randomly
 - ‚úÖ Start round one to four 
 - Make some public routes to show score and detail
 - ‚úÖ Add some sub document for participant - point, point deferential
 - ‚úÖ In net create 4 performance(player performance) and in performance add point deferential, and many more. Performance need to have key round 1 to 15
 - ‚úÖ After the foud round instead of creating a new net, we should update the existing net or performance
 - Set default value of performance (point and point deferential)

##### Round 5 to 8
 - Validate net 1 to 4, atlest 2 player need to have point for each round and all 4 round need to be done
 - Once passes all validation - create 4 more net for round 5 to 8 with all existing performance (performance need to rearrange by point)
 - do the same process for round 5 to 8
 - Rank player(performance) by point and point deferential
 - Assign the net for round 5 - rank 1 to 4 player in net 1, rank 5 to 8 in net 2 --- so on.
 - Validation - if there is point must have point deferential, two player mush have point for every round, if all round round is completed then go on
 - Make a scoring board
 - SHOULD MAKE A CURRENT ROUND AND SAVE IT TO THE DATABASE 


### Change requirements
 - 5 round with 3 game for each round in total 15 games
 - Add some filed for participant - payment amount, paid method (cash, check ), venmo slash (*confused*), (city, firstname, lastname) required



 ##### Problem
  - Component did update - login automitically and get a user
  - there are some problem with round - front-end
