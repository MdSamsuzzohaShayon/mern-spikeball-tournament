# Spikeball Events

Emojies - 📜 ⛏️ ➖ ✅


### Planning

##### Make models
 - ✅ Events
 - ✅ Participants
 - ✅ Nets
 - ✅ Rounds
 - Add unique serial no for paryicapant - track last record sl, If that is 15 start from 1
 - ✅ Upload players
 - ✅ Csv to json
 - ✅ Json file key and value validation
 - ✅ And save json object to mongodb
 - ✅ Create event front end
 - ✅ Modify add participant and show participant - Add more fields for adding a participant
 - ✅ Delete event and delete all participant of that event - Delete event frontend
 - ✅ Delete participant 
 - ✅ Add participant with files
 - ✅ when participant is been deleted delete that from events participants
 - ✅ Assign players to net randomly
 - Start round one to four 
 - Make some public routes to show score and detail
 - Add some fileds for participant - point, point deferential
 - In net create 4 players and in player add point deferential, and many more
 - Once round is increased create one more net for that round
 - Make a relationship with round and net
 - For every round create one round and more than one net
 - After the foud round instead of creating a new net, we should update the existing net


 ##### Problem
  - Component did update - login automitically and get a user
